                <p>
                    Line of Fire is a game that I recently worked on to completion alongside Aidan Mellon. This was a project that we started in Game Design I at Illinois State University.
                    We improved nearly all aspects of the game and got it printed thanks to the Game Crafter. This game will be showcased at the ISU Games Showcase later this month!
                    I worked mainly on improving the rules of the game, making sure that they are clear and easy to understand. I also worked on a handful of cards in the game that needed improvement,
                    either from a gameplay standpoint or just simply improving the wording so they made more sense. I also designed the rule sheet.

                <p>
                    My current project is one that I'm very, very excited about. This will be my first time really diving headfirst into Unity, both to structure the game within the engine, as well as programming.
                    While I have some prior experience with programming, this will be the first time that I'm really working on my own to create something. The game will be a disco-themed, top-down shooter in which
                    the player character must take down a disco run by a cult that they were once part of, but now want out! While this project is for a school assignment, I fully anticipate continuing to work on this
                    project over the summer.
