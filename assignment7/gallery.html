        <a href="https://creativetech.dev/CTK301/AdvancedCSS.html" target="_blank">This is a link</a> something that would forever change Stanley, something he would
        never quite forget. He had been at his desk for nearly an hour when he realized that not one, single order had
        arrived on the monitor for him to follow. No one had shown up to give him instructions, call a meeting, or even say
        hi. Never in all his years at the company had this happened, this complete isolation. Something was very clearly
        wrong. Shocked, frozen solid, Stanley found himself unable to move for the longest time, but as he came to his wits
        and regained his senses, he got up from his desk and stepped out of his office.

        <h2>Waymond</h2>
        <img src="Waymond.png" alt="Waymond" />
        <a href="https://creativetech.dev/CTK301/AdvancedCSS.html" target="_blank">This is a link</a> All of his co-workers were gone. What could it mean? Stanley decided to go to the meeting room, perhaps he had
        simply missed a memo. When Stanley came to a set of two open doors, he entered the door on his left. Yet there was not a single person here either. Feeling a wave of disbelief, Stanley decided to go up to his boss’s
        office, hoping he might find an answer there. Coming to a staircase, Stanley walked upstairs to his boss’s office. Stepping into his manager’s office, Stanley was once again stunned to discover not an indication of any human life.
        Shocked, unraveled, Stanley wondered in disbelief who orchestrated this, what dark secret was being held from him!
        What he could not have known was that the keypad behind the boss's desk held the answers to this terrible truth that
        his boss had been keeping from him, and so the boss had assigned it an extra secret pin number, 2845. But of course,
        Stanley couldn’t possibly have known this.

        <h2>Joy</h2>

        <a href="https://creativetech.dev/CTK301/AdvancedCSS.html" target="_blank">This is a link</a> Yet incredibly, by simply pushing random buttons on the keypad, Stanley happened to input the correct code by sheer
        luck. Amazing! He stepped into the newly opened passageway. Descending deeper into the building, Stanley realized he felt a bit peculiar. It was a stirring of emotion in his
        chest, as though he felt more free to think for himself, to question the nature of his job. Why did he feel this now,
        when for years it had never occurred to him? This question would not go unanswered for long. Stanley walked straight ahead through the large door that read Mind Control Facility.
        The lights rose on an enormous room packed with television screens.  What horrible secret did this place hold,
        Stanley thought to himself. Did he have the strength to find out?
