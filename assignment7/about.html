    <h2>
        And then one day, something peculiar happened.
    </h2>

        <a href="https://creativetech.dev/CTK301/AdvancedCSS.html" target="_blank">This is a link</a> something that would forever change Stanley, something he would
        never quite forget. He had been at his desk for nearly an hour when he realized that not one, single order had
        arrived on the monitor for him to follow. No one had shown up to give him instructions, call a meeting, or even say
        hi. Never in all his years at the company had this happened, this complete isolation. Something was very clearly
        wrong. Shocked, frozen solid, Stanley found himself unable to move for the longest time, but as he came to his wits
        and regained his senses, he got up from his desk and stepped out of his office.

    <p>
        <a href="https://creativetech.dev/CTK301/AdvancedCSS.html" target="_blank">This is a link</a> All of his co-workers were gone. What could it mean? Stanley decided to go to the meeting room, perhaps he had
        simply missed a memo. When Stanley came to a set of two open doors, he entered the door on his left. Yet there was not a single person here either. Feeling a wave of disbelief, Stanley decided to go up to his boss’s
        office, hoping he might find an answer there. Coming to a staircase, Stanley walked upstairs to his boss’s office. Stepping into his manager’s office, Stanley was once again stunned to discover not an indication of any human life.
        Shocked, unraveled, Stanley wondered in disbelief who orchestrated this, what dark secret was being held from him!
        What he could not have known was that the keypad behind the boss's desk held the answers to this terrible truth that
        his boss had been keeping from him, and so the boss had assigned it an extra secret pin number, 2845. But of course,
        Stanley couldn’t possibly have known this.

        This is the story of a man named Stanley. Stanley worked for a company in a big building where he was employee # 427.
        Employee # 427’s job was simple: he sat at his desk in room 427 and he pushed buttons on a keyboard. Orders came to
        him through a monitor on his desk, telling him what buttons to push, how long to push them, and in what order. This
        is what employee 427 did every day of every month of every year, and although others might have considered it soul
        rending, Stanley relished every moment that the orders came in, as though he had been made exactly for this job. And
        Stanley was happy.
